# ForeverAlone
Forever Alone is a game in which some spaceship is alone in dangerous space. You should move out of Saturn's orbit. Power is too low. Asteroids are too dangerous. The only thing left for you is to balance between the ability to dodge asteroids and the fear of being left in outer space without energy.
